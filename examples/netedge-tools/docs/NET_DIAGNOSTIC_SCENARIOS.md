# Network Diagnostic Scenarios for Ingress & DNS

Scenario authoring and evaluation have moved to the `genmcp/gevals` repository.
Please use that project’s canonical notes instead:

- Repository: `github.com/genmcp/gevals`
- Document: `examples/net-edge/NETEDGE_MCP_EVAL_IDEAS.md`

The gevals repo contains the up-to-date break/fix automation and guidance used
to evaluate these net-edge MCP tools.
