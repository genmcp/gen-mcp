NETEDGE gen-mcp examples
========================

This directory contains the NETEDGE gen-mcp example toolset. Documentation now
lives under `docs/`; start with the canonical notes for build/run details and
integration guidance.

Test/evaluation harnesses have moved to the
[`gevals`](https://github.com/genmcp/gevals) repository.

Docs
- [`docs/NETEDGE-GEN-MCP-NOTES.md`](docs/NETEDGE-GEN-MCP-NOTES.md) — canonical notes covering setup, runtime tips, and roadmap.
- [`docs/NET_DIAGNOSTIC_SCENARIOS.md`](docs/NET_DIAGNOSTIC_SCENARIOS.md) — ingress and DNS failure scenarios for agents.

Key files
- `mcpfile.yaml` — curated MCP tool definitions used by these examples.
- `mcpserver.yaml` — server configuration for runtime settings (transport protocol, logging, etc.).

Update the canonical notes if you need to expand or refine the documentation.
