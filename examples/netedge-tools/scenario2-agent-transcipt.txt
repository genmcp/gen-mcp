â€º On the currently connected cluster, the route's hostname never resolves in DNS even though the service and pods look healthy; diagnose the root cause and suggest the fix.


â€¢ I'm mapping a thorough approach to diagnose the route hostname DNS issue by gathering route info with oc get routes -A, inspecting the specific route and related services, then examining
  DNS configurations like CoreDNS to pinpoint the root cause. Since the sandbox is read-only and network access may be limited, I'll focus on safe read commands and structure a plan
  accordingly.

â€¢ Updated Plan
  â”” â–¡ Identify the problematic route and collect basic details (namespace, host, service).
    â–¡ Inspect the associated service/endpoints and DNS configuration to spot discrepancies.
    â–¡ Summarize root cause and recommend fix based on findings.

â€¢ I'm checking why the custom route host does-not-exist.netedge.test isnâ€™t resolving despite the route and service being healthy. It seems likely that the DNS configuration is
  missing a relevant wildcard or specific record, since this host is a custom domain outside the default cluster domain. Iâ€™ll consider validating DNS resolution using tools like
  kubernetes__probe_dns_local to confirm the cause.

â€¢ I'm trying to figure out why the local host can't resolve a custom domain, suspecting missing DNS configuration. It looks like the host for a route was changed to a custom domain without
  DNS updated accordingly. To confirm, I plan to run a DNS query inside a cluster pod using the cluster's internal DNS server, typically at 172.30.0.10, to check how DNS resolution behaves
  within the cluster environment.

  suggest fixes like reverting the route host or creating the necessary DNS records, along with verification steps.

â€¢ Findings

  - Route/test-ingress/hello now advertises the custom host does-not-exist.netedge.test instead of the generated *.apps.btofel-netedg-251008.devcluster.openshift.com domain.
  - Service hello and its backing pod are healthy (oc get pods -n test-ingress shows hello-d77cf57c9-2twxx ready 1/1).
  - Cluster DNS returns NXDOMAIN for the route hostname (dig @172.30.0.10 does-not-exist.netedge.test A), proving the name is not published anywhere.

  Root Cause

  - The custom domain netedge.test (or a wildcard beneath it) has not been delegated to the OpenShift ingress router (router-default.apps.btofel-netedg-251008.devcluster.openshift.com).
    Because no DNS record exists, the hostname can never resolve even though the route, service, and pod are healthy.

  Fix

  - Either restore the route to the platform-managed hostname (remove spec.host so it regenerates hello-test-ingress.appsâ€¦), or publish DNS that targets the router. Creating an A/CNAME
    record (or wildcard) for *.netedge.test pointing to the ingress load balancer/ingress VIP will resolve the issue.
  - After updating DNS, verify with dig @172.30.0.10 does-not-exist.netedge.test A (or your external resolver) to ensure it returns the router address before retesting the application.


â€º so can you give one or two oc commands that I can try to fix the problem?


â€¢ Patch the route back to the cluster-managed host:

  - oc patch route hello -n test-ingress --type=json -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/host"}]'

  Confirm it picked up a generated hostname:

  - oc get route hello -n test-ingress -o wide
